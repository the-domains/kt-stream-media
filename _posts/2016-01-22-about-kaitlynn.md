**About Kaitlynn**

Kait Reyell is a St. Lawrence University alumna from the Class of 2009\. Following her time at SLU, she went on to Northeastern University to obtain her Master's Degree in Journalism. She enjoys putting these skills to work creating unique Adirondack photography to share.

Growing up in the Adirondacks, Kait has captured many views with her camera that she loves to share with others. Whether it's the mountains, a close up of flowers, or snapshots of her dogs Moxie and Taz, she hopes her photography brings smiles to many.
